#Copycat

A translation of Melanie Mitchell's original Copycat project from Lisp to
Python.

To find the original information and source code for Copycat, see her
[website](http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~mm/). Any questions, comments or
issues should be directed to [me at github](http://github.com/ajhager/).

The main program is 100% done and probably 98% bug free. At this point it only lacks a proper GUI.
